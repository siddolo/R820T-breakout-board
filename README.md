# Rafael Micro R820 Breakout Board

A simple radio front-end for rapid prototyping purposes. It implements the minimum circuit needed by the R820T chip, exposing the I2C bus, the IF output, and the ACG control of the tuner.

This is a mod based on siddolo's original project.

R820T KiCad library: https://github.com/siddolo/kicad-library
